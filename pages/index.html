                <p>Drumonitor is a program for Arch Linux based systems that will read and display differant statistics about a users computer. This is mainly used in cases where you want to setup a module in a program like <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Tint2">tint2</a> or <a href="https://github.com/polybar/polybar">polybar.</a> It is written in Rust to be as performative as possible. As of now the program is able to display CPU, RAM, and network stats and can change how fast statistics are read and displayed. To read more about this, click the link below!</p>
